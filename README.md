Ecommerce Sales Dashboard

The E-commerce Sales Dashboard project aims to provide a comprehensive view of e-commerce sales performance. This is achieved through interactive and visually compelling dashboards built using Power BI. These dashboards are designed to analyze and track key Year-to-Date (YTD) metrics such as profit, quantity, profit margin, and sales trends.

Using data sourced from the e-commerce platform, the dashboard enables stakeholders to make informed decisions, identify growth opportunities, and evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
